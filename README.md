# RoboLogger
Set of software tools used to track and log the movement of FRC Robots from submitted videos. 



This is a project that has been constantly on my mind for the last couple of years. I now feel comfortable in understanding the steps necceesary to create this porject.

First part is an application that hooks up the Blue Alliance API to extract images of robots in order to create a large dataset of images of frc robots.
